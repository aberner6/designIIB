Art and design, today, refuse to settle into any established medium of expression. Various media, their tools and gadgets converge to each other. They shape content, create new cultural codes and daily practices. It is not only the communication media in convergence. With the complete digitalization of art and design production, the medium constructs the work and the work constructs the medium. So the work and the medium also merge into each other. This course, refusing all industrial norms and standards in art and communication, focuses on possibilities and aesthetics of a wide range of digital media and techniques. In three distinct modules covering web, graphic programming and physical computing, students will gain insights and a set of skills for digital modes of artistic expression and design.

As the digital technology industries take the lead, "industry without art would be brutality" (Ruskin, 1870). Humanizing technology is necessary to render it accessible and usable by everyone. Digital art invokes this process and good design is essential to introduce new technologies to everybody.

This experimental interaction survey course focused on possibilities and aesthetics of various digital media and techniques consists of three units respectively: web publishing, data visualization and physical computing. Human machine interfaces, human to human, machine to human, machine to machine interactions are also some topics to be covered throughout this course. In the final part of the course students will be asked to design and produce projects on interaction using breadboards, sensors and programming environments.

At the end of this course it is expected that students will gain knowledge on the modalities of interaction in the context of art and design practice. Throughout the course students will be asked to design and produce a project for each unit within some given constraints and also multiple in-class exercises to be announced on the day. Between each unit of the course, readings will be assigned and students will be asked to write response papers after each article.

All Mason Gross students have access to art.rutgers servers and have their personal domains under the URL:
http://art.rutgers.edu/~username

Students are responsible for building up a website on this URL to present the work done for the class, publish response papers and also to blog relevant material to course interests. In the first couple of weeks, basic HTML/CSS coding will be taught in-class workshops so that students can practice building together.

This course will also guide students to make meaningful generalizations for interpreting or evaluating digital experiences and practices in digital media, art, communication and design. The course consists of:

<b>Lecture on issues related to:</b>

- online publishing
- graphic programming
- data visualization
- interaction
- physical sensing

<b>Workshops and in-class exercises on </b>

- writing with HTML and CSS
- programming to create generative patterns and animations
- processing data
- programming for interaction
- creating circuits
- sensors and physical interaction

Throughout the semester, for programming and digital production, there will be in class demonstrations, sketch problems, one on one trouble shooting sessions etc., however the aim of this course is not to solely teach ay particular software or programming language but rather to familiarize students to various different non-linear visual platforms. 

<b>Resources</b>

All students of Mason Gross Visual Arts Department have free access to all lynda.com tutorial services. You can log in with your lab user and passwords. For example, take a look at these links:

http://www.lynda.com/search?q=processing

<b>Assignment reviews</b>

These reviews are delivered upon your presentation of the assignment on each submission date. All students in class are encouraged to participate to these reviews and discussions.

<b>Research projects</b>

There are reading sets to be assigned after each  lecture session and you will be responsible to write an annotation about them. During the semester you will be asked to explore similar works to the ones presented in lecture hours and post them on your blog. These writings and collections will help you a lot to put your ideas and knowledge together to write your thesis proposal.

<b>Tools+Materials</b>

Most of the hardware and the software which are going to be used in class will be provided and be ready in the classroom in our class hours.
On the other hand we strongly recommend that you have your own computer at home equipped with relevant software for practice and
execution of the assignments. Here is a list of software which we are planning to use during the semester:
‣ Sublime Text
‣ Cyberduck
‣ Processing
‣ Arduino
‣ Adobe Photoshop CS5
‣ Adobe Illustrator CS5
‣ Adobe After Effects

Some of the assignments will require higher processing speed and larger memories than your own computer has so please prepare yourself
to work in the lab at school throughout the semester. If you would like to attend the class with your notebook computer, of course you can but you will be responsible for your own workflow and troubleshooting.
Finally we will be using some DIY electronic boards and sensors for the final project. Basic requirement will be provided by the school but you might want to have your own Arduino UNO board. You may check the following URLs for retailers and a buying guide.

<b>Lateness+absences</b>

Three arrivals of more than 10 minutes late will count as one absence. After three unexcused absences, your fourth absence will lower your
final course grade one level. If you miss class, it is your responsibility to catch up on the work by checking the blog and contacting the
instructor via e-mail.

<b>Office hours</b>

By appointment. Please email me at:
annelieberner@gmail.com

Apart from the office hours please own a separate blog for this course and share your steps and send me a link to annelieberner@gmail.com

We will expect you to engage in research, sketch ideas and their offshoots, pursue multiple solutions to a given problem, and experiment widely with concept, imagery, type, materials and composition.
By the end of the term you will be asked to publish a video documentary of your work throughout the semester. This video will include screencasts, live action footage and talking heads. Also by the end of the semester you will be asked to make general presentation of all semester work.

<b>Grading</b>

Your course grade will be calculated as follows.
50% : an average of all assignments eliminating the least successful one
20% : final presentation performance, overall assignments
20% : coursework and blog updates
10% : an average of annotations
For project critiques, work must be presented on the announced date, at the beginning
of the scheduled critique. No late work will be accepted.
You will have two make up chances during the semester. These two weeks, you may follow from the schedule, you
will be given the chance to enhance two previous assignments. Please keep in mind that the make-up’s are only
for solving for technical problems or optimizing your work. In order to get an upgrade you should keep working on
your project even after the deadline and presentation.

A successful student of this course should be able to:
• publish text, images, animations online
• publish information driven by vast amount of online data or from a database
• publish title graphics at broadcasting quality
• relate animation with architecture
• experiment and prototype physical interactive interfaces

Please note that a C grade means you have attended all classes and met satisfactorily the requirements of the course. To earn a higher grade, you must show not only more effort but also a higher level of achievement in your work. There is no guarantee that extra effort will yield outstanding work; and yet it is extremely unlikely that without extra effort you will create interesting work or develop as a designer.
