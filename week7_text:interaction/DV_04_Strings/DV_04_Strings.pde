// A string is a special kind of array -- an array of characters.
// In other, less fancy terms, a string just holds text
String myText;

// We've actually used strings before, in println.  Any text in quotes "..." is technically a string
println("The rain in Spain...");

// But we can also store that text in a variable
// You still need the quotes, though
myText = "Stays mainly in the plains";
println(myText);
